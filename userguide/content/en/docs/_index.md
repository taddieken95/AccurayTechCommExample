Welcome to the Accuray Tech Comm Guide! This site is to function both as a resource for technical writers at Accuray, along with serving as an example for a newer, faster, more effecient way for our customers to receive our documentation.

## What is this?

This site is deployed using docs-as-code methodology. In short, this means that we author our docs in GitHub using MarkDown, and then that content is exported to a website through a Static Site Generator (SSG). In our case, the SSG is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).


## What is Hugo?

As previously mentioned, Hugo is an SSG. Hugo is a *completely free* piece of software complete with templates created by others. We simply select which template best suits our needs (for this example, I am using [docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy), which was developed by Google), clone that repository, and then rework the content and formatting to whatever best suits our needs. From a writing standpoint, the technical writer will not be required to do any formatting or web design tinkering should they not wish to. The beauty of Hugo is that all of the web design is done for us! We simply put in the content. No more mindless formatting tasks.

## How are we currently viewing this?

We are viewing this via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)! An incredibly powerful and automated server hosting platform. Netlify automatically connects to our GitHub repository and shows us how our content looks in real time.
